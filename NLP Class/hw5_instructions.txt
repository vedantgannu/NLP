Image Captioning Using a Conditioned RNN Generator

Step 1:  You will train a fairly large RNN model for this assignment. If you don't have access to a GPU, if you haven't done so for homework 4, please follow the cloud setup instructions on https://github.com/ma08/nlp_summer22_hw4/blob/main/cloud_setup.md
or alternatively https://courseworks2.columbia.edu/courses/154905/pages/gcp-setup-notes

Step 2: Clone the github repository for homework 5 (which contains a single .ipynb file).

$ git clone https://github.com/ma08/4705-caption-generator.git

Step 3: Run Jupyter notebook in the repository, as described in the cloud setup instructions above. Then open the Jupyter notebook and follow the instructions.

Step 4 *SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS*: 
When you are done with the homework, make sure that you can 
see the output of every cell. The reason we need you to 
run all cells in the notebook before you share is that 
so we can see the output exactly as you saw it. 
Neural models tend to get different outputs when 
the models are retrained. Just in case, we want 
to see the outcome as you saw it before we decide 
whether or not we want to rerun some of your notebook cells. 
Then download the notebook and upload it to Courseworks. 
You must also upload a PDF version of your notebook 
(which you can create from within Jupyter using Print -> Save as PDF).
